# Security Awareness Program Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes data on homelessness in the United States, examining the social, economic, and demographic factors contributing to it.
It demonstrates skills in data analysis, visualization, and policy-oriented reporting using Python and Google Colab, with the goal of translating complex datasets into actionable insights for addressing this critical issue.
This project was created to build on my cybersecurity training to analyze, visualize, and interpret data related to security awareness programs.  
It demonstrates skills in **data analysis, visualization, and cybersecurity reporting** using Python and Google Colab.

## Objectives
- Examine national and state-level homelessness trends.
- Identify correlations between homelessness rates and factors such as housing costs, population density, and income levels.
- Highlight areas where targeted interventions could have the greatest impact.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to inform policy and community action.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Google Colab for analysis and development
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) format for portability and reproducibility
- GitHub for version control and public portfolio presentation

---

## Key Insights
- Housing affordability strongly correlates with homelessness rates across multiple states.
- States with larger populations tend to experience disproportionately higher homelessness counts, even after adjusting for population size.
- Visual patterns in the data highlight geographic clusters where targeted housing policy changes could yield measurable reductions in homelessness.
- Socioeconomic variables such as unemployment and median income levels also show notable associations.
